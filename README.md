The â€œEasyWay" web application aims to aggregate utility services such as beauty, electrical maintenance, home cleaning, pest control, etc. The application would enable the end-user to select their preferred service, book an appointment at a convenient time, pay the resultant charge and give feedback. The primary criterion of the web application would facilitate easy calendar and time slot booking to book the services according to your time and availability. The application aims to be a one-stop shop that caters to all the utility needs of the end user. Our product promises easy booking and cancellation without extra changes and you can maintain your booked services in one place easily.

## Design

The frontend of EasyWay will be implemented using Angular JS. Users should thus be able to view and interact with EasyWay within all supported browsers. The backend of EasyWay is implemented using Node JS, with Go Lang as its web framework. And the database system which we are going to be used will be MySQL.

## File Structure

Our application is structured as follows:

| File Name   | Description                                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ProjectDocs      | This folder contains all the Project Deliverable files featured on the project Wiki page.    
| TeamPhotos   | This folder contains the photos of each team member that are used on the project Wiki page.   
| client   | This folder contains the codes for Front End.   
| db   | This folder contains the database schema and dummy data.   
| server   | This folder contains the codes for Back End server.
